# FixMatch
This is an implementation of  ["FixMatch: Simplifying Semi-Supervised Learning with Consistency and Confidence,"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07685) NeurIPS'20. in pytorch. 

## Results: Error Rate (%)

We reproduced the experiments on CIFAR-10 with 40, 250, 4000 labeled data and 5000 validation samples as the official implementation of FixMatch. But due to the limitation of computational resources, we didn’t reproduce 5 "folds". Thus, our result based on 1 fold doesn’t have the standard deviation. Our model uses the Wide ResNet-28-2 with leaky ReLU activation function. Our results are comparable to the performance in the original paper.
